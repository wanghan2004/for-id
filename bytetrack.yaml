# ByteTrack tracker settings optimized for KITTI vehicle tracking
# All tracker-specific parameters are managed here for clarity and consistency.

tracker_type: bytetrack

# --- Core Thresholds ---

# High-confidence detection threshold.
# MODIFIED: Increased from 0.5 to 0.6 to filter out more initial false positives.
track_high_thresh: 0.5

# Low-confidence detection threshold.
# Kept at 0.1 for now, as it's mainly for occlusion recovery.
track_low_thresh: 0.1

# New track threshold. An unmatched high-confidence detection must have a score higher than this
# to initiate a new track.
# MODIFIED: Increased from 0.6 to 0.7. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGE to reduce false positives.
new_track_thresh: 0.6

# --- Association ---


match_thresh: 0.8

# --- Track Lifecycle ---

# The number of consecutive frames a track can be lost before it is deleted.
# Kept at 60, which is a good value for handling vehicle occlusions in KITTI.
track_buffer: 60

# --- Advanced ---

# Whether to fuse detection scores with motion/IoU scores during association.
# Kept as True, as it generally provides more stable matching.
fuse_score: True
